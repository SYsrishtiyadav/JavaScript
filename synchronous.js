//            - 2.single threaded

// Execution Context - execute one line of code at a time
//                   - console log-1
//                   - console log-2   (each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing)

// Blocking Code vs Non blocking code (two types ke code likhe jate hai Javascript me blocking code aur non blocking code)
// Blocking code - Block the flow of program(Read File Sync)
// Non blocking code - Does not block execution(Read File Async)
